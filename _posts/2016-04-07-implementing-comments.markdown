Disqus is a free way to add a comment system to your site with social network integration.
I implemented it by first creating an account at Disqus and copied the code bits which Disqus provides for me. This code was added to my specific page, *commentary.html*.

Lastly I included a little bit of code to *post.html* to make sure the Disqus would show up and that the placement was where I wanted it to be - after the post.
