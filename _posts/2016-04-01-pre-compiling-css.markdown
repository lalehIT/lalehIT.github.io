When I first got introduced to CSS I thought it was a very interesting concept. However, I soon discovered that with the joy came repetitivness which almost took all the fun out of it.
As a person who has a hard time deciding on design, I found myself having to change my code over and over again and on several places. My excitement soon fizzled out... That is until I discovered Sass!

Sass is a preprocessor that let’s me use programming features that don’t exist in CSS just yet, to make my life easier as a designer. It allows me to work in a less repetitive and goes more along with the DRY-method (Don’t repeat yourself) applied in programming.
I can create better design with less work using far better techniques. And in the end the preprocessor converts my code to regular CSS, which the browser understands completely. Yay!

Variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance… all these words sound familiar to a regular programmer. I’ve used these techniques in my code to make everything much easier. Variables to help me with deciding on font-styles and colors. Using nesting selectors has saved me alot of keystrokes, etc. etc.

Reading this post might make you think that pre-compiling CSS sounds too good to be true. In my opinion that’s not really the case here. The only (temporary?) downfall is that you do need to use special tools for code compiling.
