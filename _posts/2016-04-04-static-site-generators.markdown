Most big projects use dynamic generated sites. But in some cases the alternative, static sites, are more preferable.
A blog is a perfect example of where it’s better to use a static site generate. For instance, on this website, which is mostly a blog, I’ve used Jekyll as a Static Site Generator (SGG) because of it’s easy hosting on Github, which is what I’m using in this assignment.

SGG produced pages are faster, weigh less and are way more secure. Using Jekyll specifically lets me write the content in a fast paced way with a simple markup language, for example markdown.
